        		<li>Tapping on the phone screen repeatedly to test your motor speed and coordination</li>
          	</ul>
            <p>
            These activities should take about 20 minutes a day.<br /><br />

We will send notices on your phone asking you to complete these tasks and surveys.  You may choose to act at your convenience, participate in all or only in some parts of the study and skip any questions you do not wish to answer.
