<p>We take great care to protect your information; however, there is a slight risk of loss of privacy.  This is a low risk because we separate your personal information (information that can directly identify you, such as your name or phone number) from the research study data to respect your privacy. Only key personnel from the study team may connect your coded study data to your name and account information if needed.<br /><br />

Even with removal of this information, in the event of unauthorized access, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual. This risk, while low, should be considered before enrolling.<br /><br />

Your coded data, including health information and location data, may be transfered to countries that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. You can de-activate the location services on the app and/or mobile settings.</p>
