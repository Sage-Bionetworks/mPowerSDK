<p>
Because this is a research study, we want volunteers to understand the purpose of the study. Also, volunteers need to understand what they will be asked to do.<br /> <br />


We will tell more about these topics in this overview. If you have questions, please contact the study sponsor by phone at <a href="tel:12066672129" style="white-space:nowrap;">+1-206-667-2129</a> (toll free at <a href="tel:18448224708" style="white-space:nowrap;">844-822-4708</a>) or email at <a href="mailto:PDApp@sagebase.org">PDApp@sagebase.org</a>

<br /> <br />

You should not volunteer until all of your questions are answered.<br /> <br />

At the end of this overview there is a short quiz. You can go back to the screens describing the study as many times as you need to pass the quiz.
